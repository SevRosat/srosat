## Welcome to Severine Rosat's Pages

I am CNRS researcher at [ITES](http://ites.unistra.fr).

### Disciplines

Geodesy, gravimetry

### Objectives
- detect core signatures in surface geodetic observables
- put constraints on coupling at core interfaces and density changes

```markdown
Geodetic observables are:
# Earth's rotation data
## GNSS surface deformation
### Space and ground gravity data

Detecting a core signature requires:
1. Good knowledge of precision, accuracy and biases of geodetic measurements
2. Reduction of geophysical effects of larger amplitude
3. Reduction of environmental fluid layers effects (atmosphere, ocean, hydrology)
4. Prediction of expected core signals (`gravito-elastic modeling` of the Earth's response to physical processes)

Indirect observations of core modes are obtained through **resonance** with external sources at the frequency of the mode. 
For instance, diurnal tides are in resonance with the _Free Core Nutation_ mode which period is quasi-diurnal on Earth.
